# HTML5-Responsive-Website
An HTML5 responsive website for a fictional film company, made by following a tutorial

This tiny project was made with an intention to learn more about the basics of HTML and CSS.
I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media on Youtube (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=338s).
However, I picked my own theme, colors and other details, and made a couple of minor changes in the layout.
