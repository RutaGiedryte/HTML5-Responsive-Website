# HTML5-Responsive-Website
An HTML5 responsive website for a fictional film company, made by following a tutorial

This tiny project was made to learn more about the basics of HTML and CSS. 
I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media on Youtube (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=338s). 
However, I picked my own theme, colours and other details and made a couple of minor changes in the layout.

The page is available for browsing at https://rutagiedryte.github.io/HTML5-Responsive-Website/.
